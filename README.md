# Number Guesser: Ultimate Challenger Edition
## Project Instructions
We were asked to recreate a game using a visual aid and notes of the fucntionality of the game. We not only had to get it
working and looking like the guide, we had also had to use clean, readable code throughout the process.

## Functionality
The users are asked to input a range of numbers between 1 and 100. When this is entered and they press the update button,
a random number is generated inside of the inputted range. It is now time for the users to input their names and guesses.
once the users have done this, they are prompted with cards on the bottom of the left side of the screen. These cards
include their name, guess and a hint for their next guess if their first one is incorrect. Once the correct number is
guessed, a winner card will appear in the right side of the page. This card has players, the winner, the number of
guesses, and a timer that has not been built into the javascript yet. The user is able to clear those cards from the screen
by clicking the close button on the card itself.
